                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a 20 year old man who is currently attending <em class="hbc">Neumont College of Computer Science</em>. I have been pursuing a game degree for the last 2 years.
                    <br>I have been messing with and familiarizing myself with code for the past <strong class="hbc">5 years</strong> of my life. It started out with messing with small game ideas. making simple fuctions in an almost empty scene.
                    <br> It had gradually evolved from there into making large projects. My fundamentals are rock solid, but I never finish the projects I start. I hope to get better at this
                    <br>I am <em class="hbc">socailly inept</em> and do not understand a lot of general social conventions. I am trying to get better at this though.
                    <br> I have a lot of self doubt issues that bubble up to the top sometimes. I don't mean to be offputting to people but it happens. <strong class="hbc">I try my best!</strong>
