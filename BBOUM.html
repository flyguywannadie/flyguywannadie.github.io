                <h1>BALL KICKER</h1>
                <p>
                    This game was created for the Neumont 2023 Winter Game Jam that lasted 2 days.
                    <br>I was the lead programmer for the project.
                    <br><br>
                    <br>I made the training minigames and rythm game systems.
                    <br>Before working on this game, I did not know how rythm game systems worked.
                    <br>My implementation is not perfect on the backend side.
                    <br>I have done a lot of research after the fact into making the system better.
                    <br>I have a better understanding of how to integrate a system into a game.
                    <br><br>
                    <br>Being my first lead position on a team, I directed code implementations.
                    <br>I made sure everyone's code was very plug and play, so putting together<br> my team's code went smoothly.
                    <br>Once a person had their code done, they put it in a test scene and it would work.
