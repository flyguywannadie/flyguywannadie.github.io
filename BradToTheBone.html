                <p>
                    This game was created for the Neumont 2023 Summer Game Jam that lasted 3 days.
                    <br>I was the character artist in this game, and had a minor role with the programming.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <br>Though my programming contributions were limited, I still had to learn about asset creation.
                    <br>I made the character visuals along with the animator that controlled Brad himself.
                    <br>My programming role was to hook up the character controller to the animated Brad.
                    <br>This taught me the importance to game feel, as I had to adjust my character animations<br>and add new ones to make the character control well.
