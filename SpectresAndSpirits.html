                <p>
                    This game was created for the Going Indie Game Jam.
                    <br>The game jam lasted 2 weeks, but I only joined on in the last week because I asked to.
                    <br><br>
                    <br>I worked on the Projectile Spawning System.
                    <br>I had to make this system flexible and scalable so that any pattern could be created.
                    <br>To do this I used my experience with scriptable objects to make different pattern objects.
                    <br>There are Circle, Shape, Image, and Sin Wave patterns that are put into a spawner.
                    <br>That spawner spawns any prefab onto the given positions of the given patterns.
                    <br>You can also specify spawning and shooting behaviour for the patterns.
                    <br><br>
                    <br>To make this system even more flexible, I added a combo pattern that lets you combine two patterns.
                    <br>This allows for flexible and creativity in making any type of pattern you want.
