                        I have been watching videos since the early to mid 2010's. I use youtube way too much. It is a big part of what I do while bored so I put it here.

                        This website was a partial birthplace for my love of game making. I never finished any projects, but it was simple and accessable for my dumb brain.
                        <br>I have friends who were into coding as well and we would make stuff on here and show eachother and it was just great.

                        It has answered every single coding question I ever needed.

                        More the product rather than the website itself. Though the forums are helpful sometimes. I have been using unity for several years now to learn how to program and make games.
                        <br>I am not that good at finishing things, but I have made a lot of ideas.

                        I played games on this website with friends constantly. It is a fun telephone game where you either draw a picture from a prompt or give a prompt to a drawing.
                        <br>It can get boring after a while, but funny things can emerge. Really good at practicing drawing under a time limit.
                        <br>You need an account to play.
