            <p>
                First and foremost I want to graduate college. I want to get a job in the field of Computer Science. I want to get my career started.
                <br>Inbetween that I got a few things to work on. I want to get my own personal projects finished, and then get them together in some sort of portfolio.
                <br>Actually having tangible evidence of my progress and work I could show people would help me immensely.
                <br>
                <br>I also hope to work on my own social skills. I want to be able to talk to people better on a more professional and causal level.
                <br>I would like to stop worrying about how I come off to people and know that I am being a good person when talking to someone.
                <br>Less confusion, and no more grave mistakes.<br>

            <h2>Future Goals/Next 20 Years</h2>
            <p>
                I want to be the big fish on top. The large kahuna. A man with control over a large amount of things.
                <br>I want to the be one in control so I can change things for the better. There are many terrible practices at play in gaming companies today.
                <br>I want to change that. I want to see those bad things get weeded out in my lifetime. That is my biggest goal.
                <br>
                <br>Other than that I would like to have several big games in my name. Have worked on instant classics, horrible flops, and the most mediocre crap on the market.
                <br>I want to be well rounded and experienced. Have a good reason to be at the place I am. I don't know everything right now. I want to learn. I want to do better than those at the top now
