            <h2>My Recent Endevors With My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                Other than my favorite video games, I have recently been playing league of legends, Ultrakill, and The Binding Of Isaac.
                <br>My favorite hobbies are coding and drawing. While I don't draw as much anymore, I have been coding a lot recently.
                <br><br>Currently I am working on a very stupid game with my friends known as Spooki Bean Man. This is based of one of my friends old <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/307123604/" target="_blank">Scratch games</a>.
                <br> I am using what I am learning at Neumont to make the game not terrible.
                <br><br>I am also making my own DND campaign that I eventually want to play with my roommates. I have the early parts of the main quest sorted out, but I just need to start working on it more than once every 2 weeks.
            </p>
