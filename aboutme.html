                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a 20 year old man who is currently attending <em class="hbc">Neumont College of Computer Science</em>.
                    <br>I have been pursuing a game degree for the last 2 years. But I also have Unity experience spanning about 5 years now.
                    <br><br>
                    <br>Programming wise, I have been dabbling in programming concepts and ideas for 6 years.
                    <br>I mainly program in C#, but have some experience in C++ and Java.
                    <br>I like solving problems in code. I can take an abstract concept and make it work.
                    <br>When I am given an assignment to complete, I am able to come up with a working prototype pretty quickly.
                    <br>I like to create things I have seen as test projects, or features in my non-test projects.
                    <br><br>
                    <br>Outside of programming, I have several interest that I pursue.
                    <br>I like drawing, playing games, hanging out with friends, taking walks, and just learning things.
                    <br>I have a unquenchable thirst for learning new things.
                    <br>I puruse game development because there are so many different things to learn.
